            The research took place in the former Mega Rice Project (MRP) area, east of the Sabangau Forest (OuTrop's main study site). In the mid-late 1990s, more than 1 million hectares of peat-swamp forest was set-aside for conversion to rice paddies, and much of the forest was cleared for the MRP. Canals were also created, which drained the area and left it susceptible to fires.
          </h3>

          <p>
            The forest clearance and subsequent illegal logging, drainage and fire resulted in over 70% of the original forest cover being lost in our core study area, “Block C” of the MRP, over the past 20 years.        A mosaic of burnt and barren landscape   with forest fragments has been left in the wake of this disaster. Any remaining forest-dependent wildlife are confined to the last remaining forest patches. We investigated how much forest remained within Block C, whether the remaining forest patches still contained orangutans, and if so, how many there were. We surveyed orangutans by counting their sleeping nests to estimate the size of the population.
          </p>
          <p>
            We found that the orangutan population has likely been reduced to less than half its original size (4,100 individuals in 1995, to between 1,500 – 1,700 in 2009). The remnant population is found within 76,755 ha of remnant forest across 29 forest fragments. Unfortunately, this fragmented population is unlikely to be viable in the long-term if ongoing habitat loss and degradation persists.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, on the bright side, we were surprised to find that there are still so many orangutans in this area and that they were still found in the smaller forest fragments. As it turns out, orangutans here are incredibly resilient – for this many orangutans to have survived twenty years of forest degradation is nothing short of remarkable! We hope this renewed focus on their plight will help increase their chances of survival. Body: Width 680px.
